<!-- the getAll query supports pagination. So make sure that there exists a count query
with the name getAll-count for such queries.
This is a complex query that supports where conditions on both orders and orderlines. However
the number of orders needs to be tracked (not the number of rows returned by the query)
Hence the count query does a count(order.id) rather than do a full count(*)
-->
<select id='getAll-count' resultType="int" >
	select count(distinct o.id) from orders o inner join order_lines ol
                on o.id = ol.order_id
    <where>
        <if test="amount != null" >
            AND amount between #{amount[0]} and #{amount[1]}
        </if>
        <if test="product != null">
            AND product in
            <foreach item="item" index="index" collection="product"
                     open="(" separator="," close=")">
                #{item}
            </foreach>
        </if>
  </where>
</select>

<!-- The getAll query supports an elaborate where clause. 
The conditional constructs ensure that the clause is constructed only if 
specific filters are passed. Notice that 
amount supports a between clause and produce supports an IN clause.
This information must be reflected in the column metadata in the definitions JSON that
accompanies this mapper.
Since this query is sortable the orderby clause is important.
Since this query supports pagination the ${pagination} is mandatory. 
We also need the count query above
Make sure that sortable and paginated are set to true in the corresponding query definitions.
Also notice that the order level where clause is in the sub-query (for temporary table u) and
that the rest of the where clause is in the main result query.
Finally notice that pagination is in the sub-query since we want to do a join only for one full
page of data rather than for all orders. This takes care of pagination as well as optimizes the
final select.
